<p style=3D'margin-top:0in'>- <span class=3DGramE>as</span> told by Rodman =
(edited
by Rewd with contributions by Ferret)</p>

<p>Ferret&nbsp;was <span class=3DSpellE>hurtin</span>' hard.&nbsp; As had
occurred just the year before, the AUG cry went out to help an <span
class=3DSpellE>AUGer</span> in need.&nbsp; And an <span class=3DSpellE>AUGe=
r</span>
in need is an <span class=3DSpellE>AUGer</span> likely without weed.&nbsp; =
For
drinking pee in DC, the society had chosen the difficult to handle <span
class=3DSpellE>flamin</span>' red Vulva, <span class=3DSpellE>er</span> Vol=
vo, to
rescue and reconnoiter with the <span class=3DSpellE>Wangster</span>.&nbsp;=
 To
rally Ferret, we returned to the basics, and while a Custom Cruiser was not
available, Rewd scrounged up a mini van.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rewd parlayed the trip into a business write-off, completed his affairs =
and
reconnoitered to Hooters near the Woodlands.<span
style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>After several hours of solo drinki=
ng and
unsuccessful hose-monster engagements, Ferret joined in.<span
style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Shortly thereafter, the two remove=
d to
BUSH intercontinental, acquired Flathead, and proceeded south to <st1:place=
><st1:PlaceName>Clear</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>Lake</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<span
style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Being first to convene, the trio
commenced to scout and start rousing some <span class=3DSpellE>rabblers</sp=
an>. <span
style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span>Not to be forgotten is <span
class=3DSpellE>Rewd's</span> noble effort to make our&nbsp;reservation work=
 at the
hotel up the street which had the sport court, thus avoiding the need
to&nbsp;crash it later in our stay.&nbsp; While the offer to fill one of th=
eir
suites was rejected, Rewd has now fathered a child for the desk clerk who w=
as
more than happy to give him her number.&nbsp; Why his fellow <span
class=3DSpellE>AUGers</span> derided Rewd for this encounter remains a
mystery.&nbsp; </p>

<p>About this time Rodman had unearthed the last remaining bottle of Captain
Morgan's in some <span class=3DSpellE><span class=3DGramE>podunk</span></sp=
an> town
in east <st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State>.&nbsp; He purch=
ased
ice at the Buy and Bag and was summarily <span class=3DSpellE>dissed</span>=
 by
the check out girl. Apparently she was unimpressed by how he checked her
out.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Back in <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Clear</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>L=
ake</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,
the motley trio got themselves to the &#8220;proper&#8221; hotel, checked in
and then proceeded to secure &#8220;F-in C&#8221; rations.<span
style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>They bought <span class=3DSpellE>g=
ro</span>-cries
and brew from a <span class=3DSpellE>souflex</span> hose with a pierced
tongue.&nbsp; Being duly impressed with the dominance of their purchases, t=
he
hose commented that she was tired of being at work and wanted to go have so=
me
fun that night.<span style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>The trio trie=
d to
lure her in (hence they got the obligatory &#8220;fishing&#8221; in for the
weekend) but alas she got away. <span
style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, the <span
class=3DSpellE>AUGers</span> acquired victuals, and there was much
rejoicing.<span style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>On the return to b=
ase, the
<span class=3DSpellE>Krispy</span> <span class=3DSpellE>Kreme</span> was ve=
ctor
triangulated,&nbsp;visually identified and logged in the <span class=3DSpel=
lE>buk</span>
of good things by the noble Flathead.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, rations were purchased simultaneously by <span
class=3DSpellE>AUGers</span> though miles apart.<span
style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>TAC, recovering from his Bag-<span
class=3DSpellE>dissing</span>, was now hauling ass to BUSH intercontinental=
 to
arrive exactly on time to get <span class=3DSpellE>Wango</span>, only to fi=
nd
that his flight was not on the big board or any board.&nbsp; Finding a flig=
ht
that had once originated in DC, he ran to that gate, then another, then&#82=
30;
well you get the idea.&nbsp; After setting the WR for circumnavigating the =
BUSH
on foot, a low voice said, &quot;Rodman.&quot; <span
style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span>The smartest, most attractive, and
morally effete member of the society wheeled&nbsp;around to find that he had
ably located the scruffy <span class=3DSpellE>Wangster</span> doc.&nbsp; Th=
ey
hauled ass south, way south.</p>

<p>Meanwhile back at the ranch, the original landing party, having adequate=
ly
secured base camp,&nbsp;found the most fuck-all Hooters ever.&nbsp; TACWANG
arrived to find their brethren surrounded by flat-chested women wearing
librarian garb.&nbsp; Though one claimed to be &quot;assigned to our
table,&quot; she delivered a beer or two and departed never to be seen agai=
n.&nbsp;
The TV's were on Home shopping club.&nbsp; A quick settling of accounts from
the Indy pool was made on the spot.<span style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>Although Rodman won the pool, he somehow got bent over, Rewd ended u=
p in
the black (even though all of his drivers were gay), and <span class=3DSpel=
lE>Wango</span>
refused to pay.<span style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Comforted by
familiar circumstances, the <span class=3DSpellE>AUGers</span> commenced AU=
Ght1
proper.<span style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>There being no further
business, the meeting was adjourned; leaving the remainder of the weekend f=
or
frolic and folly (roughly in that order).<span style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&=
nbsp;
</span>And realizing too late that they had mistakenly entered a parallel
universe (read lasers and light-wars) Hooters, they departed post-haste.<sp=
an
style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span><span class=3DSpellE>Brittania</sp=
an>
Vidal Sassoon we hardly knew <span class=3DSpellE>ya</span>&#8230;</p>

<p>At the hotel, <span class=3DSpellE>Rewd&#8217;s</span> laptop DVD was cu=
ed to
play the Grail and greet us with the castle <span class=3DSpellE>Aughhhhh</=
span>
scene.&nbsp; Rewd unveiled the &#8220;Box of Several Things&#8221; which
contained, well, you know&#8230; As it was very late already, the society c=
onvened
briefly (until <st1:time Minute=3D"0" Hour=3D"4">4am</st1:time>) to play ca=
rds,
darts, and hide the alcohol in Rodman's body (roughly in that order).&nbsp;=
 It
was generally agreed that Rodman was an alcoholic of the non-recovering
variety.&nbsp; Rewd taught us all some new dart games which he won all of..=
. Surprise!&nbsp;
In his inebriated invincibility mode, Rewd agreed to take on Flathead and
Rodman in a 2 vs. 1 affair; he was summarily pummeled.<span
style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Rodman did nail one shot to win a =
game
pledging a forehand that if he were to do so, he would get a tattoo.&nbsp; =
He
is apparently still looking for a reputable parlor.&nbsp;Rewd exchanged his
watch which was decaying and rotten, but had fifty laps, for Rodman's which=
 was
only marginally stinky.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Being fore-warned (but not fore-skinned), Rewd assured that the &#8220;g=
reat
bourbon shortage of AUG2K&#8221; would not be re-visited.<span
style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Rodman partook, excessively.<span
style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>It was oft-said, that 2-bits for e=
very
&#8220;I am <span class=3DSpellE>sooooooo</span> drunk!&#8221; uttered by R=
odman
would pay one&#8217;s way to many a distant destination.</p>

<p>The sun careened in though the window and then went in through the out d=
oor.
Rodman awoke before dawn, of course, and scouted the perimeter only to find=
 the
ghost of Andy Bowman who apparently still thinks he is &#8220;Iron Man&#822=
1;
and keeps wanting to &#8220;go go Godzilla.&#8221;&nbsp; Rodman returned to=
 the
fortress of <span class=3DSpellE>smellitude</span> and hastened the awakeni=
ng of
the troops and compelled them to watch him do eight sets of fifty pushups to
motivate them.&nbsp; They bag kicked him.&nbsp; He asked to borrow Ferret's
scuba device that he sleeps in to help avoid talking to belligerent
spouses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Flathead supplied the <span class=3DSpellE>Krappy</span=
> <span
class=3DSpellE>kreemes</span> for artery hardening fortitude and as a holdo=
ver
until the &#8220;Breakfast of the Damned&#8221; could be completed: eggs wi=
th
butter, spicy-greasy sausage, and nasty-ass gravy with butter biscuits.<span
style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>The gang consumed mass quantities =
and
there was much rejoicing.<span style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Eve=
ryone
had a wretched BM and cleaned up except Rewd, who just had the BM.</p>

<p>Thence to the sport court went <span class=3DGramE>they</span> to play t=
ip on
what was, in <span class=3DSpellE>Rewd&#8217;s</span> estimation,
&#8220;rightfully&#8221; their court.<span style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>Though they verily did crash the court, nonesuch was apparent on the
boards.<span style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Similarly, though Rod=
man
had Marley and the Wailers on the <span class=3DSpellE>jambox</span>, they =
were
not &#8220;<span class=3DSpellE>jammin</span>&#8217;&#8221; on the sport
court.<span style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>In game 1, Flathead wa=
s <span
class=3DSpellE>Cheez</span>-all and immediately departed to secure liquid (=
which
no <span class=3DSpellE>AUGer</span> had thought of a forehand).<span
style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Rewd was the Dominator in Game 1, =
having
edged out <span class=3DSpellE>Wango</span> who played a &#8220;Mary Border=

<p>Then all was blackness&#8230; <span class=3DSpellE>AUGdreams</span> were
profligate.<span style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Flathead, he <span

<p>And Flathead returned<span class=3DGramE>,</span> pouring precious water=
 into
the cracked lips of the wilted <span class=3DSpellE>AUGers</span> splayed a=
cross
the sport court (using <span class=3DSpellE>Rewd&#8217;s</span> spit-cup wi=
th a
scent of English Leather no doubt).<span style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>And Game 2 ensued.<span style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Fla=
thead
was the Dominator in that game&#8230; Surprise!</p>

<p>Flummoxed by their poor showing on the court, the <span class=3DSpellE>A=
UGers</span>
collectively determined that a curse must be upon that basket&#8230; and th=
ey
sought out a court where their rock could find more purchase.<span
style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>And find it they did at a nearby
elementary school; a 7 foot <span class=3DSpellE>kiddie</span> goal on dirt
(though Rodman insisted that the French referred to this as a &#8220;Clay
Surface&#8221;).<span style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Not surprisi=
ngly
then as this was <span class=3DSpellE>Frenchie</span> Rodman&#8217;s home
surface, he was victorious in Game 3.<span style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>In stunning fashion, Ferret, the <span class=3DSpellE>Cheez</span>-a=
ll of
Game 3 pulled a &#8220;worst to first&#8221; and secured Dominator status f=
or
Game 4.<span style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Some <span class=3DSp=

older.<span style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Return to base.</p>

<p>Refreshed by a shit, shave and shower (except for Rewd, who just had the
shit), the <span class=3DSpellE>AUGers</span>, being homers, went to the la=
st
game ever played at Enron Field before it became Typhoon Billy's&nbsp;Bait =
and
Baseball Park.&nbsp; The trip was also eventful&nbsp;in that, while waiting
outside our anti-hotel for Ferret to see if he could get <span class=3DSpel=
lE>Rewd's</span>
<span class=3DSpellE>movida's</span> #, we jammed to the song of the trip: =
Limp <span
class=3DSpellE>Bizkit's</span>&nbsp;&quot;Take a Look Around&quot;&nbsp;the=
 theme
to MI:2, better known as the &#8220;I know why you want to hate me&#8221;
song.&nbsp; No dice on the # for Ferret so he ate the whole bowl of courtesy
candy.&nbsp; The&nbsp;<span class=3DSpellE>Astros</span> were victorious&nb=
sp;and
declared champions of the universe in a grossly truncated season.&nbsp; It
rained and the&nbsp;pseudo-dome was closed and then later re-opened for the
little <span class=3DSpellE>AUGers</span> amusement.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rewd
traded&nbsp;half a can of <st1:City><st1:place>Copenhagen</st1:place></st1:=
City>
for this bad-ass dude's young and&nbsp;saucy bride.&nbsp; Ironically, the d=
ude
thought he had gotten the better of the deal, and Rewd admittedly looked a =
bit
misty as we cruised back to the hotel with the young wench going down on hi=
m.
&nbsp;Ferret not only missed the exit to Enron, but also took about twelve
hours getting us out of downtown <st1:City><st1:place>Houston</st1:place></=
st1:City>.&nbsp;
The karmic payback due almost certainly to <span class=3DSpellE>Rewd's</spa=
n>
magic parking spot in the bullpen where a guy asked if he could pay us $10 =
to
park our van.&nbsp; Then we were shuttled to our seats in a little golf cart
decorated to look like one of John Rocker's testicles.&nbsp; The return trip
resulted in what was probably the one liner of the trip, which sadly goes to
Flathead.&nbsp; <span class=3DGramE>As an ambulance passed us (the only veh=
icle
to do so the whole trip probably because the rental didn't have a V-8), Fla=
thead
deadpans, &quot;This must be a familiar view for you, Rodman.&quot;</span><=
/p>

<p>The <span class=3DSpellE>AUGers</span>, having bowels bleached by the la=
rd of
breakfast, their electrolyte balance trundled precariously on the edge of
heat-stroke, and their minds filled with the piffle of <span class=3DSpellE=
>Astros</span>
baseball, partied little and crashed at base camp.</p>

<p>The morning brought precious little.<span style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nb=

complicated; Young Frankenstein is a dominant movie!<span
style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Much bag scratching ensued while a=
ll
pondered what they wanted to do.&nbsp; Rodman, on his 40 mile run in 120%
humidity, found a nice unused Saturn rocket the boys could use to threaten
third world countries.&nbsp; The Hack of Power was secreted to the site, and
then,&nbsp;upon removal from its Asian motif tabernacle, unleashed hell on
several &quot;secured&quot; facilities.&nbsp; Of note, upon their arrival at
NASA, security permitted Rewd to flip a bitch beyond the secured area and g=
et a
parking spot right next to the &#8220;the big, pretty, rocket right over th=
ere.&#8221;<span

if they have a sign advising against it.</p>

<p>With the <span class=3DSpellE>HofP</span> safely returned to its ark, th=
e <span
class=3DSpellE>AUGers</span> determined that it was high time for a little
R&amp;R (for that&#8217;s what little <span class=3DSpellE>AUGers</span> ar=
e made
of).<span style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>On the way to <st1:City>=
<st1:place>Galveston</st1:place></st1:City>,
they passed by what must be the <span class=3DSpellE>AUGer&#8217;s</span> o=
wn
personal Chinese restaurant, &#8220;Fu Kim&#8221; (no doubt pre-fixed by
&#8220;3881&#8221; to those in the know).</p>

<p>The Hack treated us to Mexican food on the beach in <st1:City><st1:place=
>Galveston</st1:place></st1:City>
(at least we were told there was a beach there, under the seaweed).&nbsp; He
shook his threads in dismay as we searched for a frilly drink umbrella to g=
uard
his weathered skin from the perils of UV.&nbsp; There was much argument over
who would order the bitch-drink to get the umbrella.<span
style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Finally, it was decided that, fitt=
ingly,
the Black Dwarf was up to the task.<span style=3D'mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>After failing miserably, the <span class=3DSpellE>HofP</span> sugges=
ted we
fashion one, in true PHARC fashion, from a bud coaster and some <span
class=3DSpellE>swizel</span> sticks.&nbsp;&nbsp; And there was much
