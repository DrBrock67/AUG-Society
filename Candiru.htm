<p>Candiru will swim into the urethras of both men and women if
they should so decide to answer the call of nature while
immersed. It's about 40-60mm long, and only 4-6mm wide, so it can
fit. Women are more prone to attack due to the larger opening,
and also due to the fact that the fish are attracted by blood as
well as urine. Since the fish has spines that it can extend out,
removal is next to impossible without surgery. </p>

<p>However, there is a nicer method of removal (you may uncross
your legs now). The Xaqua plant, as well as the buitach apple,
will kill the fish and also actually dissolve it. Amputation,
therefore, is not necessary. </p>
