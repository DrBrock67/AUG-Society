<P>Hello fellow AUGsters:</P>

<P>I sincerely hope your collective summers have gone well and were as hot as my own.  My wife and I have taken the BAR exam, in which yours truly was Bar-B-Q'd.  Everyone says, &quot;yeah, but by this time next year you'll be rich." Let's hope I have passed, people!  So you go to Paris, France and ...</P>

<P>Just think; it was only a little over a gestation period ago that we were sitting around the campfire, singing along with Led Zeppelin on cheezy tape heads, and discussing the merits of mersch.  For those of you who survived the near death experience of the Toledo Bend reservoir trip and those of you who didn't, it's time to discuss the skeletal outline of -- you guessed it –</P>

<P>Now, before you wet your panties, fear not.  Due to hotel shortages, presidential primaries, and various and sundry other bogus inconveniences, the Jam will not be held until March 1992.  That's March, not August, David.  For the rest of you pinheads, that's the month after February 29th.  I hope you enjoy the winter olympics.</P>

<P>For the record, nothing in the by-laws forbids other Aug-like, Aug-sanctioned, Aug-spin-off excursions once the official Aug-month is set, but this will be the next mandatory meeting.  The way I see it, the date gives everyone time to decide what he's going to be when he grows up.  For those of you who have dedicated all eternity to scholarship, March is, as you will recall, Spring break month, and this coincidence should accommodate you perpetually studious geeks.  Okay?  OK.</P>

<P>For those of you who haven't forwarded your Auglet newsletter to your new address, here's a flashback.  At Augfest ‘90 only married Augsters attended.  It's difficult to say exactly what that means, but it guarantees Mr. Farris's attendance in '92.  Augsters were sadly disappointed by the replacement guest speaker, former PJC athletic director Mickey Flippen who delivered, "Your jockstrap -- friend or foe?" Other disappointments include, the fishing, the heat, the heads, not the johns, the great gnat swarm, the sad lack of manly cajun women, availability of liquor, the fishing, the Sunday church service, the heat, the motors on/not on our boats, the hac of <B>power, </B>the heat, the fishing, and the visit from the Friends of David Duke Society (They were kinda uptight until Mickey told them he was Jewish and that really loosened things up).</P>

<P>In reference to sooner Augtrips, rumor has it that a possible Aug-related triathalon may be in the works in Red Stick LA. Scheduled events are 12-pack chugging, dart throwing, and poker playing.  Anyone who leaves with a dime won't have Dru to thank.  And for those of you that are worried about the dark ages legislature taking all our constitutional rights away as we sit there in the state, don't be concerned.  This abortion law isn't so outlandish; remember Louisiana still gives the death penalty for statutory rape.</P>
<P>So, anyway, Kristi and I have set up housekeeping in the lovely Rio Grande Valley.  Drew has already panned it, so you know it must be okay.  All seriousness aside though, the worst hasn't hit yet: we can stand the heat; it's the snowbirds we'll have to watch out for.  They descend on the Valley each November.  This foul fowl wears plaid pants, flashes credit cards, never drives its Oldsmobile over 20 m.p.h., lives in aone of the region's many beautiful mobile home parks, and talks to you incessantly in grocery store lines.</P>

<P>But I digress.  As you all might expect, the new location for Augfest will be either Laguna Madre (South Padre), Lake Falcon or some other wholly unreasonable location.  If you guys want real trouble, there's Always Mexico.  My staff members are currently reviewing the possibilities.  This crusade promises to be a backstabbing good time.  The souvenir koozies you all received last time pale by comparison to this fest's prizes.  As you’ve noticed, I, the great TAChometer had to pen this letter myself because Zippo bit the biggun at Indy this year.  Your souvenirs are part of his legacy.  Fear not, as AUG Presitary, I took it upon myself to contract with Zippo's great-grandnephew to replace our legendary grand chancellor.  Therefore all further correspondence should be handled through his office at:</P>
