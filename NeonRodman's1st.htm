<P>A.U.G. (need more be said?)</P>
<P>UP from the ashes, like a set of Barreta keys, a foreboding band of</I> <I>myth monsters has arisen. I commend thee wanGO!! The wit and wisdom</I> <I>displayed in your recent call to arms has caused my loins to shrink in</I> <I>terror, what must the future hold for the faint of heart. Still, it is with</I> <I>confidence I brace myself for the cold night to come, for I know that I am chosen: I am righteous: I have paid Charon midstream and still seen both sides of the river Styx, 1 have climbed X-2, 1've lost my train of thought</I>... <I>Oh. Yes - I am a charter Augster, and I shalt know no fear.</P>
<P>This cry for the lost of our souls could not have tarried longer</I> <I>without disastrous consequences. We Indeed are near the end. 7he Lord</I> <I>shall smite us mightily, He shall come like a level 12, +4 leather armour</I> <I>clad thief in the night. Believe me, brethren. If you've got ‘em, smoke ‘em. As</I> <I>Viv’s husband Tom once said,</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Who is the third. Who walks always beside you?</P>
<P>When 1 count, there are only you and I together</I> </P>
<I><P>But when I look ahead up the white road</I> </P>
<I><P>There is always another one walking beside you</P>
<P>Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded</I> </P>
<I><P>I do not Know whether a man or woman</P>
<P>-But who is that on the other side of you?"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>-Well, it ain't yeoman purser Gopher; it's the All-mighty fellows, so take</I> <I>heed. We walk in the unreal city. -We are mere denizens of The</I> <I>Wasteland.</P>
<P>While I commend the battle cry which still rings, ooo-WAH! in My</I> <I>ears, 1 must be the first to condemn as well. Another great poet once said,</I> <I>"And 1, 1 took the road less traveled by, and that has made a markedly</I> <I>more significant than merely appreciable difference." So what is the Point?</I> <I>1'm getting there you impatient sonsabitchs! Here it is</I>...</P>
<I><P>Take flight from the cities you cowardly, urban gutter-siphonlng, filth</I> <I>mongers! Big D? Big A? Big A-wipe is more like it. 7he BallPark is a</I> <I>Mecca: no, it is Mecca. And in the words of a horribly putrid mortal Dan</I> <I>Cortez, "Been there, done that shit," And I don't think I need to remind</I> <I>anyone - it sucked!  No beer after midnight, no babes atol, no slam-fest, just</I> <I>wimped out, whiny assed, hamster loving, unpoignant, flimsy gab.</P>
<P>No offense wanGO.</P>
<P>But it's about survival! No Leda in the city, Bubba. Who needs</I> <I>candles when there's so much footcandle light pollution that the cfc's are</I> <I>aglow all night? If you head to the woods, you will have enough beer.</I> <I>Why? Because you have to. The city makes you weak. You become passive,</I> <I>believing everything is within arm's reach. And what happens when the</I> <I>remote disappears? Our families find us in the early morning white noise</I> <I>glow of our televisions, blubbering like babies. " I can't find ESPN2."</I> <I>Pitiful.</P>
<P>Furthermore, I am not buying another plane, train or bus ticket. And I am</I> <I>not driving nine straight hours. And, 1 am certainly not doing it to go</I> <I>straight to the cosmic hellhole of the skyscraper veneered Metroplex. 1 </I>will <I>go there on two conditions. (i) you get Harold Taft to personally tattoo</I> <I>an occluded front on my forehead, and (ii) you guarantee that Gaylord</I> <I>Perry will be the starting pitcher for the Texscab Rangers.</P>
<P>Besides, you can't hack on the freeway. You could die and lose your</I> <I>hack, too. It's time to go back to our roots. Big-ass fire, alphabet tent sex,</I> <I>12-gauge wire - that's what little augs are made of. The city is a cell of</I> <I>desolation, an eventual morgue. As children we longed for a ticket to the</I> <I>citv, a merry-go-round of bright lights and opportunity. -We were fools</I> <I>grasping at gold rings which inevitably were brass.</P><DIR>

<P>"If we seek solace in the prisons of the distant past</P>
<P>Security in human systems we’re told will always</P>
<P>always last.</P>
<P>Emotions are the sail and blind faith the mast</P>
<P>"Without the breath of real freedom we're getttng</P>
<P>nowhere fast"</P><DIR>

<P>I had a dream. A fishhook is lodged in my neck. A blonde</I> <I>psychologist winds two strands of six gauge wire through the eyelet and</I> <I>yanks. An aspiring med student sutures my carotid artery with legit 12</I> <I>gauge wire. Turning to the cranium minimizer I say, "I should be fuckin'</I> <I>dead now, my friend! -We just witnessed a miracle, and I want you to</I> <I>fuckin' acknowledge it!" 7he scruffy shrink says, "Okay man, it was a miracle, can we leave now?"</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hold fast to dreams, my friends, for if dreams die, life is a broken</I> <I>winged penguin, that couldn't fly to begin with, but at least his flipper</I> <I>didn't hurt so goddam much.</P>
