</FONT><P>I climb a stairway to heaven,</P>
<P>Which leads to a Keep on the Borderlands,</P>
<P>Where it happens all the time --</P>
<P>People just explode</P>
<P>Natural causes.</P>

<P>I'm drawn to a tent in the Market Square.</P>
<P>I find a man inside, whose dick, I must confess,</P>
<P>Is bigger than mine.</P>
<P>He asks my name.</P>
<P>I mumble, "Prickskin," still stunned.</P>
<P>"Pliskin," he says, "I heard of you;</P>
<P>Heard you were dead."</P>

<P>A small but muscular woman enters.</P>
<P>Unphased by the exhibition,</P>
<P>She draws me out and says, "I'm Tina."</P>
<P>I glance back toward the tent.</P>
<P>The man is gone,</P>
<P>But a pile of steaming spaghetti has appeared.</P>

<P>Her skin glistening in the sun,</P>
<P>Tina escorts me to a saloon.</P>
<P>As we enter, a man falls from the rafters.</P>
<P>It appears that he is hurt.</P>
<P>A band is playing,</P>
<P>And the best thing about them?</P>
<P>None of them is Sting.</P>

<P>Tina buys me a Rattlesnake Cooler</P>
<P>And a Dragon's Breath</P>
<P>And a Jack &amp; Coke</P>
<P>And a bong hit</P>
<P>And a Lark's Vomit</P>
<P>And a shroom ... I smile.</P>

<P>"Valkyrie," I say lustily.</P>
<P>"Uh, it's Tina."</P>
<P>"You know what would be cool right now?</P>
<B><P>Not </B>with a crossbow, but</P>
<P>The friendly barkeep sends me home,</P>
<P>But hands me a coil of wire.</P>
<P>&quot;12 gauge," he says proudly,</P>

<P>Full moon tonight; you never know."</P>
<P>I stumble into the street</P>
<P>And away from the keep.</P>
<P>A large oak looms ahead,</P>
<P>The moonlight shattering its windswept leaves.</P>
<P>A shriek splits the evening air.</P>
<P>Spinning, I whip the wire around his neck,</P>
<P>And slowly,</P>
<P>Strangle</P>
<P>A wretched little hermit</P>
<P>To death.  </P>

<P>I rationalize:</P>

<P>"He must've been, well... mad, or stupid.</P>
<P>Either way, he was evil.&quot;</P>

<P>I climb another step on the stairway,</P>
<P>And fly the Great Winged one</P>
<P>Across the Milky Way,</P>
<P>And say a silent prayer,</P>
<P>"Leda, let's have fun tonight.</P>
<P>Leda, let's Wang Chung tonight."</P>
<P>Perchance to sleep.  Perchance to dream.</P>
<P>As only Augmen dream.</P>
