<P>My fellow AUGmeisters. I <B>am </B>saddened at the lack of commitment to the preservation of our great society. It seems that we all have far too many excuses for denying our heritage and are willing to simply sit idly in the comfort (comfort being a relative term) of our domiciles while the <B>A.U.G. Society </B>fades into oblivion (yes, the melodrama is a bit extreme but deservedly so you apathetic buncha worthless bastards). If ZO§O hadn’t perished while trying to recover the original AUG flag (rumored to be ensconced in a glacier in Antarctica. <B>ZO§O </B>was, sadly, given a not-so-limited colonoscopy by a disoriented polar bear), I'm sure he would agree that this is a disturbing state of affairs.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">'And in the quick of a knife</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">They reach for their moment</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">and try to make an honest stand</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">But they wind up wounded</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Not even Dead"</P>
<P>Know what the best thing about that quote is? Wait for it.............</P>
<P>It absolutely, positively, without question, incontrovertibly ain’t Sting.</P>
<P>Will we, too, be "Not even dead" my fellow AUGsters? I think NOT. <B>Z'O§ 'O </B>was a helluva a guy but he was a softie ... a real pansy when it came to motivatin' youse guys. That's where I, the great <B>WANGSTER, </B>make an entrance. Never having been known as a subtle individual, I will simply say that if this epistle fails to elicit a response from you pretendin' ta be heterosexual types (that means FAGS, Farris), I will personally come to your door and jump-spinning back-kick the living bejeezus out of you. I will plunge myself into a decade of living hell in another six months and you better believe I plan to rot as much of my brain and destroy as much of my liver as possible before the fact. AND I plan to do it on one weekend-long binge along with my fellow AUGmates. However, I won't be too demanding in this first communiqu&eacute;. I will simply attempt to nail down the time for the:</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=6><P ALIGN="CENTER">FIRST AND PROBABLY ONLY A.U.G SOCIETY</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SINGLE MALT SCOTCH</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SIAM-FEST AND HURRICANE THROW-DOWN!!!</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P>To prove my sincerity and commitment to this inAUGural event, I have just broken out the good scotch glasses and poured an eye-popping ratio of Chivas to </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>H20. </FONT><FONT SIZE=4>I will also bring a bottle of one of the smoothest and sneakiest scotch whiskeys you will ever have the pleasure of wrapping your taste buds around. Of course, my alcoholic bent will not prevent us from engaging in other activities during this fun filled weekend. An attempt to schedule these other activities will be made over the course of the next few weeks ... wait ... an IDea! Charter AUGster, Rude, mentioned an interest in road-tripping to Big D (or A in this case) to watch the fuck-au Rangers play the fuck-all Indians in a fuck-all baseball game in the most dominant stadium on the planet, The BallPark in Arlington! ooooWAH! This COULD be IT! The rallying point for which we were searching! (short pause while I plug in the now energy-depleted Powerbook and throw in another CD) If we follow this plan of attack, then housing for the meeting is cheap (my patio would rent for a mere $58.32 per night) and Rude can bring along AUGster wannabe Mark (BIG no) whatsisname. I can acquire good seats for the game (45 yard line! I swear! That's what she told me!) through local channels. AWright. A multitude of exciting events can flow outward from this centerpiece. Of course we run the risk of seeing replacement players rather than the real thing but once you see the new BaRPark you can pretty much blow off anything happening on the field. Ok. I have the place. I have the booze. I will have the tickets. I can get the women. I have the hamsters. Wait. Strike that. Disregard that last sentence. Actually, the last three sentences. Actually the last four. ...wait..the last FIVE .... fuggit.</P>
<P>Anyway, THAT is the tentative outline. I’ll acquire tickets for a Saturday or Sunday game and everyone can plan on arriving Friday evening or Saturday morning with departures Sunday evening or Monday morning. I can assure you that the time surrounding the game will NOT be dull as I will see to it that, even if whatever we're doing sucks, we'll be so blasted we won’t know or even care.</P>
<P>In conclusion, my fellow AUGlutinators, I say that, though the once-great <B>A.U.G. Society </B>is in disarray and on the edge of total annihilation, we must beat back the darkness that threatens to close in upon us. We can no longer be passive. We must stand up and preserve our great tradition or else slip into a nether region of apathy far worse than death. Who amongst you are TRUE AUGlodites?</P>

<P>Who will be strong and stand with me? Somewhere beyond the barricade</P>
<P>Is there a world you'd like to see?"</P>
</I><P>I will expect a reply from each of you within one week of the receipt of this letter.</P>
<P>At this time you need only relate a measure of your enthusiasm for this event. The times and dates will firm up as I receive the replies. As I am well aware of the illiteracy that runs amok in our group, my phone number is included and responses via Ma Bell are encouraged as the primary form of communication. For the computer illiterate, my Internet address is also included.</P>
