BIRTHRIGHT

When once a mighty galleon sailed across
a tempest tossed and vicious northern sea,
A Viking lord by mutineers was tossed
into the depths for drinking his own pee.
When Mexico considered Tejas hers,
there was a band of willing volunteers.
One left the Alamo for rescuers.
Alas, he'd had a few too  many beers.
Centuries on toward modern day we've moved
and yet our noble lineage holds true.
Though gentlemen, we're often told were crude,
engaging in imbibing ghastly brew.
Animalistic tendencies abound.
Are we to be denied our sacred crown?
