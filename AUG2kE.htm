<p><strong>Neon Rodman using deceased Zofo pen name calls AUGers
to arms (11/28/99)</strong></p>

<p>Since there will only be us survivalists alive in the new year
we need to<br>
celebrate our enduring the whining demise of those spineless
primates with<br>
whom we have walked the Earth lo these many years.&nbsp; By
spring you should've<br>
taught your families how to keep the fire stoked and the
firecrackers at a<br>
safe distance.&nbsp; So I'm taking a poll:&nbsp; rank your
weekends; name your places<br>
(three of each) and I'll get back to you.&nbsp; But hurry!&nbsp;
Soon that CRT your<br>
staring at will be a doorstop in your steel reinforced
bunker.&nbsp; You did use<br>
steel didn't you?&nbsp; Of course you did.&nbsp; And they laughed
at us when we<br>
cornered the 12-guage wire market.&nbsp; The fools!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Zofo Lives!!!!!!!<br>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Wango's reply to flurry of Zofo/Rodman
e-mail responses (12/4/99)</strong></font></p>

<p>I walk back into the apartment after 40 hours sans sleep only
to be <br>
bombarded by no less than 30 e-mails the vast majority of which <br>
pertain to an event that seemed long since dead....passed into <br>
oblivion alongside big brown gunboats that reeked of strawberry
car <br>
freshener and Ferret's parachute pants. Who would have surmised
that <br>
Rude would be so inspired that he would create a web page devoted
to <br>
the memory of such AUGust deeds? `Course since he quit working
and <br>
made Lisha support the family by prostituting herself he's got a <br>
surfeit of time on his hands.<br>
<br>
I am moved by this veritable avalanche of communication.
Sufficiently <br>
moved that I am willing to move myself to whatever place from
which <br>
the call of AUG beckons. Sadly, my time frames of potential <br>
attendance are somewhat restricted: February and June- I can
probably <br>
manipulate my schedule to shift some vacation time into those
slots. <br>
Other times might be possible but the bribes that would have to
pass <br>
into the hands of the Chief Resident to make the necessary
changes in <br>
my schedule would have to be of sufficient size to buy a small <br>
galaxy. If we are to make this happen we need to get a firm time
ASAP <br>
so that all AUGsters can start formulating the necessary lies to
be <br>
distributed to employers, spouses, etc, as needed.<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Deleterious Jones attempts to summarize AUG2K
intentions (12/8/99)</strong></p>

<p>AUG:<br>
Someone please provide to me Rodman's current work number<br>
so that I may get his ass in gear. <br>
<br>
I am stimulated to the point of hubris by the piffle being <br>
trafficked amoungst us AUGsters (particularly from Flathead <br>
and Gorbag). Flathead's latest e-mail has further stimulated <br>
me to erection - chicks like that really do exist (there's <br>
hope for us all). <font size="1"><strong>{editors note: this pic
is available in the photo gallery}</strong></font><br>
<br>
The following responses from AUGsters have been received:<br>
<br>
Wango - 2/25 is good (avoids chief resident genuflecting and
fellatio)<br>
Flathead - &quot;I'll check with my wife&quot;<br>
Gorbag - no response {presumed dead}<br>
Rodman - no response {pounding pud in corner}<br>
Ferret - &quot;It's cold here and I'm afraid to go outside until
May. <br>
And there's really scary birds on the beach in February <br>
that make me wet myself.&quot;<br>
Rews - &quot;I am dominant. My wife turns tricks whilst I pound
pud. <br>
I will be there whenever.&quot;<br>
<br>

<p><strong>Deleterious Jones friskily launches piffle &amp;
raillery at fellow AUGers (12/14/99)</strong></p>

<p>Verily Ferret.&nbsp; They must have jobs-<br>
{akin to the work of Calvin &amp; Hobbes}<br>
For nay, they do not give us time...<br>
they only seek to spin a rhyme.<br>
<br>
or, in Haiku,<br>
<br>
FAGamaniacs!<br>
Do they give the time of day?<br>
NO, they pound their pud.<br>
<br>
or, in Limerick,<br>
<br>
There once were some faggoty AUGurs,<br>
who'd rather do &quot;work&quot; and pick boogers,<br>
Than take a little time<br>
To drop an e-dime<br>
And speak on their personal 'druthers.<br>
<br>
<br>
But seriously,<br>
<br>
{not really}<br>
<br>
The lay of the land (although true, I am not speaking of my wife)
is like this -<br>
<br>
Potential AUG approved locations:<br>
1) S Padre (post march, to avoid scatalogical sea-fowl &amp; wild
geezer gangbangs)<br>
2) PHARC Burial Grounds (provided they are not a toxic waste dump
now)<br>
<br>
Potential AUGable dates are:<br>
1) Feb 25-28<br>
2) Some time in June<br>
<br>
AUG things we know:<br>
1) Gorbag can't do anything starting in June<br>
2) Wango can only do February or June (AUG date 1 works for him).<br>
3) Flathead is still talking to his wife (whilst pud-pounding in
the corner).<br>
4) Sally lives in a pink house.<br>
5) Rodman can't stay on track, respond promptly to e-mails, or
give an answer<br>
6) Ferret dislikes: seabirds, snow, elderly humpamaniacs, the
letter &quot;L&quot;, snow, &amp; indecision<br>
7) One priest must accompany two natives.<br>
8) Wango works too much.<br>
9) Rewd doesn't work enough.<br>
10) Hose is dominant.<br>
11) F'in C's are fuck-all.<br>
12) The total of all sides must equal 11.<br>
13) There is no consensus on what we should do.<br>
<br>
So how 'bout a little chatter out there.&nbsp;
Counter-proposals?&nbsp; A letter<br>
worthy of inclusion in the AUG archives?&nbsp; Let's get some
pud-poundin'<br>
goin'!!!<br>

<p><font size="5"><strong>There followed an immediate absence of
notable chatter for </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>a period of precisely 100 days... and
then...</strong></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Deleterious Jones quickens the pace (3/26/00)</strong></p>

<p>Well ruck me funnin'<br>
<br>
The Johnson's sold their house in AusTex to the guy across the
street (with<br>
the two dogs, Ebony &amp; Ivory).&nbsp; So it's buster there
too...<br>
<br>
Quick, one of you sorry motherfuckers make a million dollars and
treat us<br>
all to an all-expenses paid trip to a global destination of your
choosing<br>
(and I don't mean 'almost a million' or 'not even a million').<br>
<br>
I'm waiting....<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, we could still unite in ParTex and camp at Pat Mayse
if worse<br>
comes to worser.....<br>
<br>
We can probably still eat at Taco Delite for free....&nbsp; and I
may have some<br>
keys to Pizza Inn lieing around here somewhere.&nbsp; That's if
we don't want<br>
Dave's football-flavored burgers and MD 20/20.... or Flathead's<br>
pizza-inn-spaghetti &amp; crown royal vomit-o-rama deluxe...<br>
<br>
Gotta go.... I'm gettin' hungry.<br>
<br>
June 4 still a green light?<br>
<br>
Rewd<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Deleterious Jones offers a &quot;firm&quot; plan (3/30/00)</strong></p>

<p><br>
AUG:<br>
<br>
&quot;Now is the time for all great men to cum&quot; --- Rewd<br>
<br>
Drop your socks &amp; grab your cocks ladies, cuz it's AUG
time!!!!!<br>
Cum ye hither to PHARC-Land on June 2 to June 5 (or thereabouts).
<br>
<br>
Wangster, quit with the life-savin, heart breaking, &amp;
love-takin <br>
(you joan jett wanna-be) and bring your entire hairy ass down <br>
to Texas.<br>
<br>
Flathead - I'm callin' you out.... Pack everything in the nearest
<br>
L'il Black &amp; White Truck and make trails.<br>
<br>
Gorbag: If you ain't dead already, I'm gonna hunt you down if <br>
I don't see you that weekend.<br>
<br>
Ferret, Rewd, &amp; Rodman - You dominate, no cheese, double
souflex.<br>
<br>

<p><font size="5"><strong>meandering indecisiveness... and

<p><strong>Ferret gets pissed (5/11/00)</strong></p>

<p>So what the hell is up with you pathetic pukes? I think the
best <br>
part of you ran down the crack of your mothers' ass! I bet you're
<br>
the kind of peter puffer that would fuck a guy in the ass and not
<br>
even have the God damn common courtesy to give him a reach
around! <br>
Well, that's enough Hamburger Hill...<br>
<br>
Maybe this will help inspire you. The ranch is definitely going <br>
to be sold. We have contract in hand. Wait...the good news is <br>
that it doesn't close until late June. So this is it guys...no <br>
more PHARC...no more stump trained cattle. <br>
<br>
This is our last shot...ever!!! <br>
<br>
So what say you???<br>
<br>
and could someone please pass this along to flathead and copy me?
<br>
I've lost his e-mail address.</p>

voice calls (5/17/00)</strong></p>

<p>Nay!&nbsp; Dud it is not!&nbsp; Get ready Wango it's time to
drink pee in D.C.&nbsp; That's <br>
right -- AUG 2000 is hitting the road.&nbsp; Farris, Rude And
Rodman are coming to <br>
crash at your pad starting 6-23-00.&nbsp; More details to
come.&nbsp; Rude, get your <br>
travel agent working on hooking me dfsooner and you up at DFW to
catch the <br>
same American flight to D.C. between 1 and 3 on Friday.&nbsp; WE
both have <br>
alternate forms of payment so make sure she's aware of that
issue.&nbsp; Joel, <br>
Gorbag coming?&nbsp; We're committed or should be.</p>
