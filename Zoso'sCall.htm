<P>Hello all you AUGlodites!!!!</P>
<P>It's all set. The ballots have been cast, the site selected and the second-ever, sorta-annual AUGFEST is all but underway!!!! The response has been better than that to G.B. Trudeau's strip on no state income tax. Everyone put in their two cents, except of course Wango, but we all know how he is about that kind of cash., Anyway, here's the geetus...</P><DIR>

<P>Time:&#9;Anytime Thursday the twelfth of March through Monday the sixteenth. 3-12/16-92. Feel free to come any or all of that time. Probably no one's schedule will accommodate all that time but that should allow everyone time to make a brief appearance.</P>
<P>Place:&#9;Due to its geographic location in the center of the state and our desire to see just how committed Drew is to this outing, Lake Travis will be the locale for the greatest AUGfest on record. This lovely lake is truly a wonder of engineering, and was created by the erection in 1937-41 of Mansfield Dam -- a 213 foot thick monstrosity with a generating capacity of 93,000 kw's.</P></DIR>

<P>We will camp on the south shore in the impressive 1,520 acre park known as Pace Bend (a.k.a. Paleface Park). This is located west of Austin off Hwy. 71, headed toward Llano. You turn north on F.M. 2322 and its 4.6 miles to the park. Please refer to the enclosed literature. If you're coming from the north, please catch 620 off I-30 well north of Austin; you'll save muchas miles that way; it's more scenic; and, it eventually hits 71. We'll try to set up camp as close as possible to the Baptist encampment. That way our hell-raising won't be for naught. So, if you arrive after dark look for us at the back of the park.</P>
<P>We may or may not have access to water other than from the lake, so if you've got a massive jug definitely bring it. At any rate, our accommodations should be no worse than last time, and whatever we don't have we'll wahoo!</P><DIR>

<P>In case you're interested, these are the final results of the survey:</P><DIR>

<P>1.&#9;Most AUG members practice safe sex.</P>
<P>2.&#9;Each is handling gas problems in his own unique way</P>
<P>3.&#9;Almost all are almost always walking around erect.</P>
<P>4.&#9;The twelve gauge wire problem has been <U>solved</U>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.&#9;Joel does need to bring Drew a pole, for which Drew will put up a spool of 12 gauge wire as collateral.</P>
<P>6.&#9;We should be sponsored by Anheuser Busch.</P>

<P>Here's some friendly packing advice. Make lists, keep up with those lists, and check items off once when you've located them and a second time when they're in the car. Everything you'll need or want, sans bedding, can be put in a 3 cubic foot box, and a smallish cooler. You can figure out what goes where. Here's a list of necessities:</P>
<P>Water</P>
<P>a change or two of clothes</P>
<P>matches/lighter</P>
<P>toiletries</P>
<P>flashlight</P>
<P>a flask/bottle of hoo'ch</P>
<P>Off</P>
<P>trash bags</P>
<P>sack lunch</P>
<P>sleeping bag</P>
<P>a jacket for day 1</P>
<P>pillow</P>
<P>durable footwear</P>
<P>spare cash</P>
<P>12 gauge wire</P>
<P>soap</P>
<P>hot pad</P>
<P>pocket knife</P>
<P>map</P>
<P>extra keys?</P>
<P>toilet paper</P>
<P>hatchet</P>
<P>koozie</P>
<P>paper towels</P>
<P>prescription items</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I don't know how to make-it easier. Don't forget the miscellaneous stuff that makes for a fun campout. I think you can come up with your own goodies on that front.</P>
<P>Consider carpooling, it saves money, helps the environment, and gives you someone to blame when you get lost. I hope you can all find a way to be at the event, but if you can't, you can take solace in the fact that you'll be bad-mouthed unmercifully around the fire. Wouldn't it be better to sit there and take it in person? Until then, vayan con Dios, Los Animalisos quien Beben Orina.</P>
