<P>Hello disheartened Auglodites,</P>
<P>Now is a time of great turmoil in the universal scheme. Our group stands on the very edge of extinction.  We look out over a great chasm.  We wonder what can save us. The answer my friends?  No, it is not patience.  Nor is it fortitude.  Even camaraderie cannot save us.  What we must cling to, in this, the darkest hour of augliness, is apathy.  Not since the time of the great Dionysius has a band of rascals carried the torch of prudence so carelessly.  Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. (sorry typing class flashback).  But cereally folks, we must not give up hope because we should never have held hope.  If all is lost, then in that chaos we have truly found ourselves.  Though disbanded and befuddled we remain bound together in the great brotherhood of anarchism which hath carried (tossed) us this far.</P>
<P>I put it to you, my brothers that we have refined ourselves.  We have lined our pathways with cobblestones when we should be skimming them across emerald pools, shattering the placid surface into a hundred colliding rings. our loyalty is to the future and not to the moment.  I commend to your disdain my past efforts at organization -- the pitfall of all great triumphs.  No more I say.  If the future holds a great roadtrip, outing or visitation, it shall come despite our failure to plan such.  And this is as it should be.  We who have prided ourselves in our collective unpredictability, must strive to outpace ourselves, to confuse ourselves, to, by God, surprise ourselves.</P>
<P>This is why I put it to you all; ponder not the road not taken, but take it up.  And when you do, whenever it is, call a fellow augster.  Perhaps he will come, perhaps not, but he will call another if he can, and that augster may follow.  I propose a great augchain, which someday will lead us all to form an oblique circular link kinda deal around a great augfire somewhere in this nation.  Until that fine moment, when I will laugh greatly at all your ugly mugs, remember, the best plan is no plan.  But bring the twelve gauge wire.</P>
